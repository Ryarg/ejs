News & Feature Facility
We have recently developed a dedicated news and feature facility that will operate through one of the North West's leading news agencies. 

How does it work?
If you have something innovative or newsworthy happening in your business -then give us a call. With 25 years experience in the media, Peter will be able to advise you whether the proposed material will have sufficient impact to attract coverage and therefore be distributed - Its a win situation. If we feel the "story" merits coverage we will gather all the necessary information from you, and distribute the finished news story or article to all relevant publications and where appropriate radio and TV - at no cost to your company.

Our News and Feature division is just another channel of communication and part of our Marketing and PR service. If you feel that a sustained and targeted media and public relations campaign would be more appropriate than a one off news feature, we are happy to arrange an informal meeting to discuss an outline strategy.

We offer PR, direct mail campaigns, advertising media sourcing, event planning & management.
